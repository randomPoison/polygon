# Polygon

> A rendering engine written by someone who knows nothing about rendering.

Polygon is an experimental rendering engine written in Rust. It primarily exists so that I can
experiment with common rendering techniques and learn more about 3D rendering. It's not meant for
any kind of production use, though feel free to play around with it if you like. It's being openly
developed, and I'm happy to take contributions, bug reports, and general feedback.
